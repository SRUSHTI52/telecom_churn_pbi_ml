# Customer Churn Prediction & Power BI Dashboard Project

This project performs **end-to-end churn analysis** using machine learning and **interactive Power BI dashboards**. It not only predicts whether a customer will **stay or churn**, but also provides **deep business insights** using data visualizations.

---

## What This Project Does

1.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** using Python (Pandas, NumPy).
2.  **Trains a machine learning model** (Random Forest) to predict customer churn.
3.  **Validates and tests** the model on unseen customer data.
4.  **Exports prediction results** to a CSV file.
5.  **Creates an interactive Power BI dashboard** to help stakeholders explore customer behavior, revenue, service usage, and churn trends visually.
